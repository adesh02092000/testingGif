# Three - Part III

### Geometries

* Composed of **vertices** (point coordinates in 3D space) and **faces** (triangles that join those vertices to create a surface)
* Can be used for meshes and also for particles
* Can store more than just positions (UV coordinates, normals, colors or anything that you want)

We can use the vertices to create meshes as see earlier, but we can also use individual vertex to create particles
Each vertex can act as a data point and can store values like position, color, normals, UV coordinates and so on

**Three JS built-in Geometries**
Can explore more [here](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=geometry) in the docs. All these geometries inherit from the class Geometry and has many built-in methods like `translate(...)`, `rotateX(...)`, `normalize(...)`, etc. By combining these geometries we can create more complex structures

>  Remember these method are for individual vertices and for the entire mesh

##### Box Geometry

Takes in 6 parameter

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2);
```

* `width` : size on x axis
* `height` : size on y axis
* `depth` : size on z axis
* `widthSegments` : Subdivisions on x axis
* `heightSegments` : Subdivisions on y axis
* `depthSegments` : Subdivisions on z axis

Subdivisions corresponds how much triangles should compose a face, 
`1` = 2 triangles per face
`2` = 8 triangles per face

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1);
```

![1Subdivision](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146973484-f48661a7-bf0f-46aa-8a56-d1c09ff9b4b4.png)

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2);
```

![2Subdivision](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146973582-ed9ff2ed-d6dd-4e0a-9fa9-8e724be9f738.png)


To see these segments set `wireframe` : true, in the material

```javascript
const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x9105f5, wireframe: true })
);
scene.add(mesh);
```

**Now why are these segments needed?**
If we have a flat cube it is of no use, but if we wanted to make a mountain like structure, then we can set the heights of these individual segments to achieve the result

#### Create our own Geometry

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.Geometry();

// Create individual vertices, and add them to the geometry's vertices array
const vertex1 = new THREE.Vector3(0, 0, 0);
geometry.vertices.push(vertex1);

const vertex2 = new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0);
geometry.vertices.push(vertex2);

const vertex3 = new THREE.Vector3(1, 0, 0);
geometry.vertices.push(vertex2);

// Now create a face to join the vertices, Face3 contains the indexes of the vertices from the vertices array
const face = new THREE.Face3(0, 1, 2)
geometry.faces.push(face)

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color: 0xff0000,
  wireframe: true,
});

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
```

![Triangle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146973638-d03dea86-a8a5-44c8-b02a-753a62873762.png)


**Creating a bunch of triangles**

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.Geometry();

for(let i = 0; i < 50; i++){
   // Create 3 vertices
  for(let j = 0; j < 3; j++){
    geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(
      Math.random(),
      Math.random(),
      Math.random(),
    ))
  }

  // For each 50 triangle add the face
  const verticesIndex = i * 3;
  geometry.faces.push(new THREE.Face3(
    verticesIndex,
    verticesIndex + 1,
    verticesIndex + 2,
  ))

}

const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color: 0xff0000,
  wireframe: true,
});

const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(mesh);
```

![BunchOFTriangles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146973674-4ed44525-17e2-44ce-aed1-e4c8dd1ea2ff.png)


Now these triangles are in a `1x1` cube and is not centered, since `Math.random()` gives values from 0 to 1, to make it go from `-0.5` to `0.5` 

```javascript
for(let j = 0; j < 3; j++){
    geometry.vertices.push(new THREE.Vector3(
      (Math.random() - 0.5) * 3, // 3 is the amplitude
      (Math.random() - 0.5) * 3,
      (Math.random() - 0.5) * 3,
    ))
  }
```

#### Buffer Geometries

There is no support for `Geometry()` constructor any more, but we have Buffer Geometries instead, which are more efficient and optimized. Almost all the built-in geometries have a buffer version as well

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BoxBufferGeometry(1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2);
```

**Create our own Buffer Geometry**
To store the buffer geometry data, we use `Float32Array` (JS concept [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float32Array))

* Types array (only floats allowed, can't mix data types)
* Fixed length
* Easier for computers to handle

2 Way to create and fill the `Float32Array`

```javascript
const positionsArray = new Float32Array(9);

// 1st vertex
positionsArray[0] = 0
positionsArray[1] = 0
positionsArray[2] = 0

// 2nd vertex
positionsArray[3] = 0
positionsArray[4] = 1
positionsArray[5] = 0

// 3rd vertex
positionsArray[6] = 1
positionsArray[7] = 0
positionsArray[8] = 0

// OR

const positionsArray = new Float32Array([
  0,0,0, // 1st vertex
  0,1,0, // 2nd vertex
  1,0,0  // 3rd vertex
]);
```

We now need to convert the Array into a `BufferAttribute`

```javascript
const positionsAttribute = new THREE.BufferAttribute(positionsArray, 3); // The second argument is the itemSize, which is 3 in case of vertex since they take up 3 index, If we were setting the size of a particle which only requires one index, the itemSize will be 1
```

We can now add the `BufferAttribute` to our `BufferGeometry` using the `setAttribute(...)`

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
// position is the name of the attribute and is used in the shaders
geometry.setAttribute("position", positionsAttribute);
```

Now we have our triangle
![BufferTriangle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146973744-2bf442ca-8ec5-4c1e-9642-a07cb198ef6f.png)


> Notice, that this time we didn't provide the face, it was handled automatically

Creating a bunch of triangles

```javascript
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();

const numOfTriangles = 50;
// numOfTriangles * 3 * 3, since each triangle has 3 vertices and each vertex will be composed of 3 values (x, y, z) 
const positionsArray = new Float32Array(numOfTriangles * 3 * 3);

// Fill the array with random values
for (let i = 0; i < numOfTriangles * 3 * 3; i++) {
  positionsArray[i] = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 3;
}

const positionsAttribute = new BufferAttribute(positionsArray, 3);
geometry.setAttribute("position", positionsAttribute);
```

Now set `numOfTriangles` to 5000 and we get this
![TonOfBufferTriangle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146973792-94711004-f721-4e68-baa7-6b25dc45bd5d.png)


### Debug - `UI`

We need it to tweak and debug easily, we can find the perfect color, speed and quantity. It's like inspect element for three JS
We can create our own debug UI, or use a library, there are several options

* `dat.GUI`
* control-panel
* `ControlKit`
* `Guify`
* `Oui`

Let's use `dat.GUI`
Start with a simple cube with `OrbitControls`

**Setup**

```shell
npm install --save dat.gui
```

```javascript
import * as dat from "dat.gui";
const gui = new dat.GUI(); // Initialized
```

Just with this we have our controls panel, on the page, but it is empty right now
There are different types of elements(tweaks) you can add to the panel, most of them are similar to HTML

* Range: For value with min and max range
* Color: To pick colors
* Text
* Checkbox : for boolean values
* Select: Multiple Choice
* Button
* Folder: To organize the panel, when there are to many elements

#### Adding elements to the panel

We can do it using the add method, 

```javascript
// Use the add function only after the object is created
// Parameters
// 1st : Target Object
// 2nd : Prop Name : String
gui.add(mesh.position, "y");
```

With this now we can put a number in the input and the y coordinate for the mesh changes
To create a range 

```javascript
// New parameters
// min, max and step in which to increment
gui.add(mesh.position, "y", -2, 2, 0.01);
```

Adding all the axes

```javascript
gui.add(mesh.position, "y", -2, 2, 0.01);
gui.add(mesh.position, "x", -2, 2, 0.01);
gui.add(mesh.position, "z", -2, 2, 0.01);
```

```javascript
gui.add(mesh.position, "y").min(-2).max(2).step(0.01); // Produces the same result
```

To change the default label of "y" which is same as the property name, we use name()

```javascript
gui.add(mesh.position, "y").min(-2).max(2).step(0.01).name("red cube Y"); // Helpful in case there are many objects
```

Mesh inherits from `Geometry3D` which has a property of `visible`

```javascript
mesh.visible = false; // the mesh disappers
```

Let's add it to the UI

```javascript
gui.add(mesh, "visible"); // Adds a checkbox
```

We can do the same for wire-frame

```javascript
gui.add(material, "wireframe"); // Since wireframe is the property of material, hence the target object is material
// OR 
gui.add(mesh.material, "wireframe");
```

**Changing the color**
To change color we need to use the `addColor()` method instead of `add()`, 
Also

```javascript
console.log(material.color) // Gives the instance of Color class
```

There is no way to get the color, hence we need to store the color in a separate object, and then pass to the `gui`, 

```javascript 
const parameters = {
  color: 0xff0000,
};
gui.addColor(parameters, "color")
```

Now this does changes the color but that color is not applied in the cube, 

```javascript
// Use the onChnage function to set the color each time it is changed in the debug UI
gui.addColor(parameters, "color").onChange(() => {
  material.color.set(parameters.color);
});
```

Since we now have a object containing color, lets use in while initialization also

```javascript
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
  color: parameters.color,
});
```

From the above example, 

> Give the target object to the add function and the property to be changed and the GUI will figure out on it's own on how to, whether to use range, or button or checkbox on its own  

**Triggering a function**
Say we wanted to trigger a function on a button click, but since a function is not an object we can't pass it to the add function, hence here also we need to place the function inside the object in-order to use it

```javascript
const parameters = {
  color: 0xff0000,
  spin: () => {
    console.log("spin");
  },
};

gui.add(parameters, "spin");
```

Install `gsap`

```javascript
import gsap from "gsap";
// ...
const parameters = {
  color: 0xff0000,
  spin: () => {
    gsap.to(mesh.rotation, { duration: 1, y: 10 });
  },
};

gui.add(parameters, "spin");
```

Now the cube rotates on clicking, but after 1 click since the cube it already at y : 10, it does nothing, 

```javascript
const parameters = {
  color: 0xff0000,
  spin: () => {
      // Take the current value and 10 each time
    gsap.to(mesh.rotation, { duration: 1, y: mesh.rotation.y + 10 });
      // OR, add 2 rotation each time
    gsap.to(mesh.rotation, { duration: 1, y: mesh.rotation.y + Math.PI * 2 });
  },
};
```

#### `dat-GUI` Tips

* Press H to hide and show the panel on the browser

* If you wish to start the site by hiding the panel, use `gui.hide()`

  Press H to bring it back

* To start the site with the panel collapsed use `const gui = new dat.GUI({closed : true})`

* Can also provide a default width `const gui = new dat.GUI({width : 400})`, although we can drag to resize on the browser

### Textures

Textures are images, that cover the surface of geometries. There are different types of textures and each produce a different effect.

##### Color (or `Albedo`) texture

It is the most simple and most used texture, and it is applied on the geometry. 

##### Alpha Texture

This is a greyscale image, white part of the texture is visible and black is not. Mostly used for transparency and other similar effects

##### Height (Displacement) Texture

This also is a greyscale image, needs subdivision. We can use it to move the vertices and create terrain like effects  

##### Normal

* Add details
* Doesn't need subdivision
* The vertices wont move
* Lure the light about the face orientation
* Better performance than adding a height texture with a lot of subdivisions

##### Ambient Occlusion

* Gray scale image
* Adds fake shadows in the crevices
* Not physically accurate
* Helps to create contrast and see details

> All these textures are available in static file of the texture project

##### Metalnesss

* Gray Scale image
* White is metallic 
* Black is non-metallic
* Used mostly for reflection

##### Roughness

* Greyscale image
* Mostly works as duo with metalness
* White is rough
* Black is smooth
* Mostly for light dissipation

There are a ton of more textures. But lets limit ourselves here

#### PBR

The textures defined above (especially metalness and roughness) follow the PBR principles

* Physically Based Rendering
* It used some real Mathematics and physics calculations to achieve realistic results
* It is becoming the standard for realistic renders (Unreal engine, Unity, Blender, Three JS all use it)  

**Must read for PBR**

https://marmoset.co/posts/physically-based-rendering-and-you-can-too/



#### Loading a texture

**Accessing the image**: Put the image in `/static/` folder and access it directly

```javascript
const imageSource = "/textures/image.png"; // add the path excluding the static file
```

Loading texture using native JavaScript

```javascript
const image = new Image();
// load calls the callback function once the image is loaded
image.addEventListener("load", () => {
  const texture = new THREE.Texture(image);
});
image.src = "/textures/door/color.jpg";
```

Now we can use the texture in the material, but wait this won't work since texture is local to the callback function

```javascript
const image = new Image();
// Move texture outside the event listener
const texture = new THREE.Texture(image);
image.addEventListener("load", () => {
   // call for update once the image is loaded
  texture.needsUpdate = true;
});
image.src = "/textures/door/color.jpg";

//...
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ map: texture });
```

![DoorTexture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146973949-b7ce2b5b-3f06-4fee-879c-48988df45ccd.png)


##### Using `TextureLoader`

Three JS built in class for loading texture

```javascript
const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
const texture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/color.jpg"); // Done
```

One texture loader can load multiple textures.
We can also pass 3 more arguments to the `load()`, which are all function that run while loading, processing and error

```javascript
const texture = textureLoader.load(
  "/textures/door/color.jpg",
  () => console.log("Loding"),
  () => console.log("Processing"),
  (e) => console.log("error", e) // also get the event
);
```

**Loading Manager**
Keeps a track of all the pending and the loaded asset, we can use it to show a loading bar while the assets are loading and then show the webpage once all the loading is done

```javascript
const loadingManager = new THREE.LoadingManager();
loadingManager.onStart = () => {
  console.log("Loading Started");
};
loadingManager.onProgress = () => {
  console.log("Loading on Progress");
};
loadingManager.onLoad = () => {
  console.log("Loaded");
};
loadingManager.onError = () => {
  console.log("Error");
};

const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader(loadingManager);
const texture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/color.jpg");
// Loading Started
// Loading on Progress
// Loaded
```

Let's load multiple assets

```javascript
const loadingManager = new THREE.LoadingManager();
loadingManager.onStart = () => {
  console.log("Loading Started");
};
loadingManager.onProgress = () => {
  console.log("Loading on Progress");
};
loadingManager.onLoad = () => {
  console.log("Loaded");
};
loadingManager.onError = () => {
  console.log("Error");
};

const textureLoader = new THREE.TextureLoader(loadingManager);
const colorTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/color.jpg");
const alphaTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/alpha.jpg");
const ambientTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/ambient.jpg");
const heightTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/height.jpg");
const metalnessTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/metalness.jpg");
const normalTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/normal.jpg");
const roughnessTexture = textureLoader.load("/textures/door/roughness.jpg");

// Loading Started
// (7) Loading on Progress
// Loaded
```

### UV Unwrapping

Now how does a 2D jpeg image covers a 3D cube (or any 3D object), as a texture. The answer to this is UV unwrappinp. A mapping technique that takes the 3D Coordinates of the object, maps it into a 2D plane, (which is the UV plane). 
UV unwrapping is the step done before we can apply a texture image to any 3D object, because it tells the software the position, rotation and scale of the texture on each face of the model.

The best way to visualize this is by imagining that, the model is made out of paper(or cloth) and we are trying to lay it flat on a surface. To do this, we need to make cuts(technically seams) in our mesh so that different parts of the model can unfold into a plane.

![uvUnwrapping](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146974016-6885eb49-c9dc-49ec-a0e6-a8d6265abb1a.gif)


After this the texture is projected on the UV plane and we get the result.


![unWrapping1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146974064-83e9d955-178e-491f-849c-da3fb6fa5787.gif)


Now based on how we have made the seams, we can get different results. The places where we have seams there is a discontinuation in the texture and where there no seam the texture is continous

![SeamOn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146974127-079e4579-b890-463a-af0f-8c695b3957db.png)

![SeamOff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43462814/146974146-f6553ccb-4c96-434e-9853-13a69a269887.png)

Hence the aim of the game to make as much seams as possible to flaten the object and to avoid visible seams.
